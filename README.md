Information on the theme can be found in the style.css file.
This theme is a layout for WordPress.  You can install http://wordpress.org for free and then use this free theme by installing it in the /themes/ directory in your wp-content folder.
This theme should be installed in a subdirectory of /themes/ called /GrandFork/.  By default GitHub unzips into a more verbose folder name which may also work but this setup may be sub-optimal.
